# Trading-Card-Database-Application

Created a database for a dummy trading card website. This database is filled with many fictional cards, buyers, posts, etc. Using SQL, my collaborators and I were able to fill a database with the entities shown in our ER diagram (which is posted in this repo)

Having tables created for the database with SQL, we then created a Java UI in order for users to review cards, buy cards, sell cards, update profile, etc. The Java code would send requests with SQL code in order to make these changes through queries.

Some examples of queries like finding percentages of posts of each status (open, closed, archived, deleted), and other visualizations.

Note: The code needs to be connected to the database to run and you need permissions to access the database
